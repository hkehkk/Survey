# Survey

#
Creating the farm survey was a fun project. I have not created a survey until now. I love creating buttons in the HTML and this project had many. From page to page, consumers fill out information regarding their farming practices. The goal of this project was to collect information to store in a NoSQL database. The database design is a project I did separate to this one, but available to view in my repositories.
To build this project, I first took notes on what information would be useful to a farming entity. I then decided what I thought would be the most appealing design for answering multiple questions, and I decided that multiple pages of a few questions would be the best fit. 
The overall process was a learning experience. Surveys are created all the time. I find many people don’t like to take surveys unless they receive something in exchange, like a gift card. Sure, a bonus is always great, but I feel that having an appealing and user-friendly web design may encourage more people to fill out surveys as they are very helpful in collecting information. 
This survey project has helped me grow my ability to carry input from page to the next – this is very important to me. Doing the same programming multiple times is what I find to be the most beneficial in remembering code that I will use continuously.
